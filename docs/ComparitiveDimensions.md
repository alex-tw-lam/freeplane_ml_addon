Conceptualizing the Abstract Thought Vector
We can conceptualize this abstract thought vector as a "Comparative Dimension" or "Polar Thought Axis". This dimension represents a spectrum or continuum along which two nodes or branches can be positioned and analyzed. Each end of this axis represents an opposing or complementary conceptual pole, allowing structured exploration of differences, similarities, strengths, weaknesses, or other comparative attributes.
Formal Definition:
Comparative Dimension (Polar Thought Axis):
A conceptual axis defined by two opposing or complementary poles, each representing a distinct conceptual perspective or attribute. Nodes or branches are analyzed and expanded along this axis, generating structured insights and comparisons.
Generating the Two Poles of a Comparator Vector:
To systematically generate the two poles of the comparator vector, we can follow these steps:
Step 1: User Input or Selection
Allow users to select from predefined comparison types (e.g., "Pros vs Cons," "Strengths vs Weaknesses," "Risks vs Opportunities," "Left Wing vs Right Wing," "Cost vs Benefits," etc.).
Allow users to define custom comparison types, which are then saved for future reuse.
Step 2: Semantic Expansion via LLM
Once the user selects or inputs a comparison type, the LLM can semantically expand each pole into structured sub-concepts or branches.
Prompt the LLM explicitly to generate structured sub-branches for each pole based on the context of the selected nodes.
Example Prompt Structure:
Copy
Focus
Given the two nodes "[Node A]" and "[Node B]", analyze them along the comparative dimension "[User-defined Comparison Type]". Clearly define two opposing poles for this dimension, and generate structured sub-branches for each pole, relevant to each node.
Step 3: Structured Output
The LLM returns structured outputs clearly separated into two poles, each with their own set of generated child branches.
These outputs are then automatically added as child nodes under each selected node, clearly labeled by their respective poles.
Example Scenario:
Nodes Selected:
Node A: "Renewable Energy"
Node B: "Fossil Fuels"
User-defined Comparison Type:
"Environmental Impact vs Economic Viability"
LLM-generated Poles:
Pole 1: "Environmental Impact"
Renewable Energy:
Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
Fossil Fuels:
High carbon emissions
Air and water pollution
Environmental degradation and habitat loss
Sustainable resource management
Pole 2: "Economic Viability"
Renewable Energy:
Higher initial investment
Fossil Fuels:
Lower short-term costs
Established infrastructure and markets
Economic risks from resource depletion and volatility
Job creation in emerging sectors
Implementation in UI/UX:
Clearly label each pole in the mind map interface.
Automatically generate and visually group child nodes under each pole.
Allow users to further expand or edit these generated branches manually.
Benefits of this Approach:
Provides clear, structured, and meaningful comparative analysis.
Encourages deeper exploration of concepts along clearly defined axes.
Enhances usability by saving custom comparison types for future reuse.
Leverages LLM semantic capabilities to generate insightful and contextually relevant branches.
This structured approach to defining and generating comparative dimensions (polar thought axes) will significantly enhance your mind mapping plugin's analytical capabilities and user experience.
